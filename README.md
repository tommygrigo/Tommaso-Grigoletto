Hello my name is
# Tommaso Grigoletto
This website acts as my online resume.

## About me
I am an automation engineer and currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Padua. 

My research interests are in the field of control system theory. Topics of interest include: most importantly quantum information and control but also non-linear systems and the use of machine learning methods as a tool to study and control complex systems.
